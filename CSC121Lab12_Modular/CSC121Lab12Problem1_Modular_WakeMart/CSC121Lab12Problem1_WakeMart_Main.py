# Program requirements:

# This problem is about modular design.
# We are writing a program to simulate a self-checkout system of a store named Wake-Mart.
#
# This program has three tasks at the top level: input prices of items, input coupons and process payment.
# Processing of payment is further divided into two subtasks.
# The customer can choose either to pay by cash or by debit card.

# import modules
