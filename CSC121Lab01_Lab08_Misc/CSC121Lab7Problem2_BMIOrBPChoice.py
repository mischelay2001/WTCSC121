# Program Requirements

# Some users of the program in Problem 01 do not want to do both health tests.
# Rewrite the program so the user can choose one of the following:
# (1)	Calculate BMI only
# (2)	Determine high blood pressure only
# (3)	Do both
#
# Your program should continue to have three functions.
# Do not make any changes to the calc_bmi and hypertension functions.
# In the main function, display the options to the user and ask the user to choose.
# Invoke the proper function(s) based on the userâ€™s choice.  The following is an example.
#
# Health and Fitness Program
#
# Enter 1 to calculate BMI only
# Enter 2 to determine whether you have high blood pressure only
# Enter 3 to do both
# Enter your choice: 3
#
# Enter height (in inches): 67
# Enter weight (in pounds): 150
# Your BMI is: 23.490755179327245
#
# Enter your systolic pressure: 132
# Enter your diastolic pressure: 91
# You have high blood pressure.
#
# Save your program in a file named Lab07P2.py.  Submit it to Blackboard for credit.
