""" Program requirements:

Write a new version of the DriveCar project you wrote in Problem 1.  
Create a new Python project DriveCarNew and copy the files from the old project.  
Make the following changes to class Car:

(a)	Change all instance variables to private
(b)	Write getter method for speed.
(c)	Define a __str__ method to display the carâ€™s make, model and speed.

Do the following in the main module:

(a)	Get make and model from the user and use the input data to create an instance of Car
(b)	Display the Car instance with a print statement
(c)	Write a loop to allow the user to control the speed of the car just like the old project. """
